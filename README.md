# Xamarin.Forms.Playground

This repo is to play around with some concepts and learnings within Xamarin.Forms.

Things currently exhibited in this repo:

* Simplified background image layering with a Grid
* ControlTemplates for templating ContentPages
* netstandard target for optimal support (1.2) found [here](https://oren.codes/2016/07/09/using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard/)

Things still to prove or experiment with:

* Event subscription management
* XAMLC padding issues with generating IL (perhaps the new [Xamarin.Forms 2.3.4.184-pre1 package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms/2.3.4.184-pre1) will fix this?)
